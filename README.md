This project utilizes a local language model (LLM) to extract essential details, such as Name, Email, and Mobile number, from resumes. The extraction process is driven by a specified prompt provided to the LLM. The user interface is implemented using Flask and HTML, allowing users to easily upload their resumes and receive the extracted information.

The workflow is user-friendly: individuals upload their resumes, and the application processes them through the local LLM, presenting the relevant details. The local deployment of the LLM ensures privacy and security, as the extraction is performed locally without reliance on external services.This project aims to simplify the process of resume information extraction by combining the capabilities of a local LLM with an intuitive web interface, providing users with a seamless and secure experience.
